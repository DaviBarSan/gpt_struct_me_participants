Man dies in shark attack on beach in northwest Australia
A man died today after being attacked by a shark while swimming at a beach on the western coast of Australia, in what is the eighth death of its kind in the country this year, international agencies report.
The 55-year-old man was alone in the water at the tourist beach of Cable, in northwestern Australia, in the Indian Ocean, when the shark attacked him on the thigh and bit his hand.
The victim was removed from the water with serious injuries and treated by police and then paramedics, but it was not possible to save him and he died at the scene.
The police then killed the shark, which remained in the area for almost half an hour after the attack, and closed the beach, famous for its 22 kilometers of white sand.
The number of deaths from shark attacks this year in Australia - eight - is the highest since 1929, when nine people died.
In 2019, there were 27 shark attacks, but no one died.
According to studies by the government scientific agency CSIRO, dated 2018, Australia has around 2,210 adult white sharks, considered the most dangerous.
