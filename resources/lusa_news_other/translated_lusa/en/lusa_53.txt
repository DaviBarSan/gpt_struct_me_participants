Dutch government approves aid to KLM after pilots agree to pay cuts
The Dutch government approved on Tuesday a rescue plan for the air carrier KLM, worth several billion euros, after pilots accepted a five-year salary reduction.
Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra had frozen aid, in the form of loans, to the Dutch branch of Air France-KLM, following the refusal of the VNV pilots' union to accept the salary reduction.
But KLM meanwhile announced that the union had given in, which led the government to say it was ready to lend 3.4 billion euros, according to news agency France-Presse (AFP).
KLM plans to reduce expenses by 15% and eliminate five thousand jobs.
Around three thousand pilots are expected to be particularly affected by this plan, with salary cuts that could reach up to 20%, according to the country's media.
Air France-KLM lost 1.6 billion euros in the third quarter, which compares with a profit of 363 million in the same quarter last year.
