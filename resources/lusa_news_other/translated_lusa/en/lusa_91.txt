Man gets electronic bracelet for threatening and persecuting ex-partner in Gaia
A 28-year-old man, with a criminal record for drug trafficking, was left with an electronic bracelet today for insulting, threatening and persecuting his ex-partner, in Vila Nova de Gaia, said the GNR.
In addition to being controlled by an electronic bracelet, the detainee is prohibited from contacting the victim by any means, from frequenting the same places and from approaching her within a radius of 800 meters, this police force said in a statement.
As part of an investigation into domestic violence, the GNR military found that the suspect insulted, threatened and persecuted the 30-year-old victim, he stressed.
“In recent months he has engaged in various controlling and persecuting behaviors that have led to several episodes of threats, even causing damage to the victim’s vehicle,” he added.
