Jakarta government outlaws Indonesian radical Islamic group FPI
Indonesia today outlawed a Muslim group responsible for acts of vandalism against Western embassies and non-Islamic places of worship.
Security Minister Mohammad Mahfud told journalists that the Islamic Defense Front (FPI in Indonesian) maintained activities despite orders to disband the organization.
The Jakarta government also banned the use of FPI symbols.
The radical group, which wants to see Islamic law (Sharia) implemented in Indonesia, a country with 230 million Muslims, has been expanding its influence among the population in recent years through humanitarian and charitable missions.
The FPI organized large protests in 2016 and 2017 against the Christian governor of Jakarta.
The organization's leader, Rizieg Shihab, handed himself over to authorities at the beginning of December after being accused of inciting the population to violate the restriction measures imposed by the Government to curb the covid-19 pandemic in the country, organizing large manifestations.
