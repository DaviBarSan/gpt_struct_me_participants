Man dies in house fire in Ribeira Brava
A man died today following a fire that broke out in his home, in the municipality of Ribeira Brava, due to “possible smoke inhalation”, a local fire department source told Lusa.
According to the same source from the Ribeira Brava and Ponta do Sol Volunteer Fire Department, in the west of Madeira, “the man was already dead due to possible inhalation of smoke and gases”, as “the room where the victim was located did not present fire signals.”
“When we arrived there, the fire was already in the entrance hall of the house and had already consumed a bedroom, but not the room where the victim was,” declared Roberto Gonçalves, head of service at the corporation.
The alert for the fire was given at around 10:00, he said, and when members of the corporation extinguished the flames they found the victim, who lived alone, already lifeless inside.
The president of Ribeira Brava City Council, Ricardo Nascimento, told Lusa that “the police forces are still investigating the causes of the fire”.
The victim, he said, was “a man in his 70s.”
