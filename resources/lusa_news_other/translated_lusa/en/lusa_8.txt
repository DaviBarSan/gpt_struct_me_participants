Three dead in hippopotamus attack while crossing a river in the Angolan province of Bié
Three people died in the municipality of Camacupa, in the Angolan province of Bié, following an attack by a hippopotamus, public radio reported today.
The incident occurred when crossing the Kwanza River, when the artisanal boat, with eight people on board, suffered an attack by that mammal.
According to one of the survivors, the attack took place early on Sunday night, when the peasants were leaving the fields, highlighting that among the dead was a child whose body was missing.
The communal administrator of Muinha, Baptista Sambango, said that the incident was made known to the municipal administrator, stressing that due to the size of the river it is necessary to build a bridge for the population to cross.
