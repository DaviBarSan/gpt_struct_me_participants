Preventive arrest for Trofa man suspected of domestic violence
A 60-year-old man was detained in preventive detention after being detained in Trofa, Porto district, for being suspected of repeated domestic violence against his 59-year-old wife, the GNR revealed today.
The arrest, made on Tuesday by the Center for Investigation and Support for Specific Victims (NIAVE) in Porto, occurred after the military found "that the attacker, repeatedly, inflicted verbal and psychological abuse and even death threats against victim, his 59-year-old wife."
In a statement, the GNR describes that the woman "took refuge in an unknown location, afraid of the death threats she had received" and, from then on, the "suspect, a habitual consumer of alcoholic beverages and with psychiatric problems", began "going meeting the victim at his place of work, continuing the crime."
The detainee, "with a criminal record for committing this type of crime", was present for the first judicial interrogation on Wednesday at the Matosinhos Judicial Court, where he was "applied to the coercive measure of preventive detention", the statement said.
The action was reinforced by the Trofa Territorial Post.
