Man kills seven people and injures seven others with a knife in northeast China
At least seven people were killed and seven others were injured in a knife attack in northeast China, state media reported today.
The attack in the city of Kaiyuan, in Liaoning province, was carried out outside a sauna and a bathhouse, with the suspect being identified by the media with the surname Yang.
The suspect was detained, but the motive for the attack remains unknown.
Chinese law restricts the sale and possession of firearms, and mass attacks are often carried out with knives or homemade explosives.
Perpetrators of similar attacks carried out in the past have been described as mentally ill or as having a grudge against society.
In previous attacks, a knife-wielding school security guard injured at least 39 people at a kindergarten in the southern region of Guangxi in June this year, and was sentenced to death.
In 2018, a man killed one person and injured 12 others in a knife attack in a shopping center in Beijing.
