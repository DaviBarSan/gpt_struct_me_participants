Judicial authorities search Maradona's driver's home
Argentine judicial authorities today searched the apartment of Maximiliano Trimarchi, Diego Maradona's driver, as part of the investigation into alleged negligence in the death of the former Argentine footballer, which occurred on November 25.
In a statement, the San Isidro Attorney General's Office said that the searches, during which the driver's cell phone was seized, were ordered after learning that Trimarchi was with Maradona when he died, at his home in San André, in province of Buenos Aires.
The police have already carried out tests on the cell phones of Leopoldo Luque, Maradona's doctor, who participated in the operation on a subdural hematoma to which the former footballer was subjected at the beginning of November, and psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov.
Two days after the death of Maradona, aged 60, the Argentine court opened an investigation to determine whether there was medical negligence in the care of the former footballer.
