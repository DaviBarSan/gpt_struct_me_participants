GNR arrests 59-year-old man in Maia for mistreating his father
The GNR announced today the arrest of a 59-year-old man for mistreating his 89-year-old father, committed in the municipality of Maia, in the district of Porto.
In a statement, the GNR explains that following a complaint about mistreatment of an elderly person, it was found “that the aggressor, since leaving prison in September 2019, had attacked, insulted and coerced the victim, his 89-year-old father , giving him money to satisfy his drug addiction.”
These facts led to the issuance of an arrest warrant, which was carried out on Wednesday by GNR soldiers from the Maia Territorial Post.
The detainee is today undergoing his first judicial interrogation at the Matosinhos Criminal Instruction Court for the application of coercive measures.
