House collapse kills at least eight people in India
A house collapsed in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad due to unprecedented rains and severe flooding that killed at least eight people, local police said today.
In addition to the dead, four other people were hospitalized after a wall fell onto a neighboring house, which collapsed on impact.
Heavy rain in Hyderabad broke a record set 20 years ago, with flooding in low-lying areas of the city, where authorities used boats to evacuate people.
More than 9.6 million people across South Asia have been affected by severe flooding this year.
Around 550 people have died in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, while millions have been displaced from their homes since the floods began in June.
