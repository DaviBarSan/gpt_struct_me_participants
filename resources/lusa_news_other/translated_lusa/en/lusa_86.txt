Man preventively arrested in Penafiel for forcing partner into prostitution
An investigating judge ordered the preventive detention of a 47-year-old man who the Public Prosecutor's Office (MP) of Penafiel indicted for forcing the woman he lived with to prostitute himself, a police source reported today.
In a statement, the Judiciary Police, who detained the man and took him to the investigating judge on the recommendation of the MP, also revealed that the victim, aged 26, was placed in a shelter for people subject to this type of crime.
The woman “had been living together since 2017 with the defendant, who subjected her to sexual exploitation on public roads, keeping the profits obtained from this practice”, according to the PJ.
Since then and to this day, the police report, “the victim ran away from the subjection to which he was subjected a few times, but was located by the suspect and forced or convinced to return to him, under the promise of receiving the narcotic product from which he is dependent, which the defendant gave him.”
The MP in the district of Porto-Este, in Penafiel, indicts the man for the crimes of human trafficking for sexual exploitation, kidnapping and rape.
