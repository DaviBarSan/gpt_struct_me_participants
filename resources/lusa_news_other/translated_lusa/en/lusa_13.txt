Mozambican authorities seize more than a ton of crab
Mozambican maritime inspection seized 1,100 kilos of crab, in the center of the country, in less than a week, caught in the "veda season", when it is prohibited to catch the species, an authority source told Lusa today.
The latest seizure happened on Saturday when authorities discovered a vessel with 600 kilograms of crab.
“We are seizing crabs and vessels and those responsible face heavy fines if they are neutralized”, explained the head of inspection, César Maphossa.
On Saturday, the crew abandoned the boat, anchored on the outskirts of the city of Beira, central Mozambique, when they noticed the arrival of inspectors.
The vessel was confiscated and the crabs, hidden in boxes, were later returned to their natural habitat, in the Maria River mangrove, on the outskirts of the provincial capital of Sofala.
The seizure occurred less than a week after authorities discovered another 500 kilograms of crab also caught during the ban period, which began in September and runs until the end of the year.
The closed seasons aim to maintain and sustainably exploit marine species, giving them a period without capture that allows their populations to recover.
