Covi-19: Australian state government apologizes for errors in hotel quarantine
The leader of the government of the Australian state of Victoria today apologized for the errors in the quarantine program in two hotels that led to the majority of deaths from covid-19 in the country.
Following the release of the investigation report, Victorian Premier Dan Andrews explained that the quarantine system had been implemented quickly and without a pandemic rulebook.
“I want to apologize to the Victorian community for the very clear mistakes that were made in this program,” Andrews said.
Weak controls at two quarantine hotels triggered a wave of infections in Australia's second-largest city, while the rest of the country had been largely virus-free.
Of the 908 Australian deaths from Covid-19, 820 died in Victoria.
Police now provide security at Melbourne's quarantine hotels, something that in this case was done by private security guards.
the state of Victoria had not recorded a case of community transmission for 52 days and Melbourne airport began accepting international arrivals this month for the first time since the beginning of July.
