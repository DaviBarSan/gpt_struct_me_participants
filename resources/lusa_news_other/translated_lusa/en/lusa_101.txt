Viana do Castelo court sentences man who shot another man to 12 years in prison
The Viana do Castelo Court today sentenced a 36-year-old man to 12 years in prison for shooting another man in the city in 2013.
The man was accused of qualified murder, but ended up being convicted of simple murder, as the murder weapon was not found.
During the reading of the ruling, the presiding judge of the panel said that the defendant, who is in pre-trial detention after seven years on the run, and who was not present in the courtroom, was acquitted of two other crimes of which he was accused, namely one crime of harm to qualified physical integrity and the other of possession of a prohibited weapon.
The judge explained that "the documentary and testimonial evidence" produced during the trial, which began in October, was not sufficient to convict those two crimes.
The collective that judged the case also decided to sentence the man to pay compensation to the mother of the fatal victim in the total amount of 141 thousand euros.
