White House leader travels to Syria to try to free US citizens
A White House official made a secret visit to Syria for high-level talks aimed at the release of two US citizens reported missing in the country during the civil war.
The information was released on Sunday by the Wall Street Journal and cited by the Associated Press (AP).
According to the AP, an advisor to Donald Trump, Kash Patel, went to Syria to seek the release of those two citizens, one of whom was journalist Austin Tice.
This trip is the first trip to Syria by a high-level US official in years.
If he wins the release of Tice, a Texas journalist who disappeared while covering the conflict in 2012, it would be an important victory for Trump.
The other missing person is Majd Kamalmaz, a 62-year-old clinical psychologist from the State of Virginia, who disappeared in 2017. He is believed to be detained in one of the Damascus regime's prisons.
There have been no confirmed visits by high-level US leaders to Damascus since the closure of the US embassy and the return of the ambassador in 2012.
