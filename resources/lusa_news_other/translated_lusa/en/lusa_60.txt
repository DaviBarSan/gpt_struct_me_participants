Man seriously injured after attack with a bottle in a restaurant in Palmela
A 69-year-old man, owner of a restaurant in Cajados, in the municipality of Palmela (Setúbal), was seriously injured today, after being attacked in his establishment, with a bottle, said a GNR source.
The same source told the Lusa agency that the victim was transported "in a coma" to the São Bernardo hospital, in Setúbal.
According to the GNR source, the attack was carried out this afternoon by a woman, "apparently drunk", who fled in a car.
The attack, according to the guard, was motivated by the fact that "the owner of the restaurant did not want the woman to be consuming alcoholic beverages near his establishment", as "the consumption of alcohol on public roads is prohibited".
According to a source from the District Relief Operations Command (CDOS) of Setúbal, two other people involved in this incident suffered minor injuries, and both were also transported to the São Bernardo hospital, one by ambulance and the other by their own means.
According to the CDOS, firefighters from the Águas de Moura corporation were mobilized to the site.
