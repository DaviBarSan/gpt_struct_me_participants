Hit men with links to drug trafficking kill seven people in the Mexican state of Michoacán
Hired killers (sicarios) possibly with links to drug trafficking shot dead seven people in the Mexican state of Michoacán, local authorities reported on Wednesday, stating that the victims' bodies were abandoned on a rural road.
The victims' bodies were found by a group of agricultural workers on a road in the municipality of Tangamandapio, the local Public Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.
In the same informative note, the Public Prosecutor's Office stated that the victims – six men and one woman – showed, in addition to the gunshot wounds, serious signs of torture.
At least three of the bodies were dismembered.
The identity of the victims is, at this time, unknown.
Authorities are considering several lines of investigation, but admit the possibility of this incident being related to drug trafficking and issues of revenge between rival cartels.
Violence with links to organized crime is one of the greatest scourges in Mexico, being responsible for several hundred homicides per year in that country.
