OE2021: Deputies waited for the Government to start the second day of debate
The second day of debate, in general, on the State Budget for 2021 began today in parliament five minutes late, due to the absence of Government members.
After reading the file, at 10:06 the president of the Assembly of the Republic, Ferro Rodrigues, announced that the debate would begin, if the members of the executive were not present in the room.
“As soon as they arrive, we will immediately begin the debate,” he said.
There followed a five-minute wait, unusual for this type of debate, with the deputies chatting in the hemicycle.
It was 10:11 when the Prime Minister, António Costa, arrived and, after the ministers rearranged the chairs on the Government bench, including Ana Gomes Godinho, Labor, and João Pedro Matos Fernandes, Environment, the head of Finance began to speak a minute later.
