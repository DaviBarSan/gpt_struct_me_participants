Police officer fatally shot by colleague during argument in Maputo
A Mozambican police officer was arrested, accused of killing a colleague during an argument in the province of Maputo, in southern Mozambique, a police source told Lusa today.
"They were arguing, for reasons so far unknown, and in the middle of that one of the members shot at the other, fatally shooting him," said the spokesperson for the Police of the Republic of Mozambique (PRM) in Maputo province, Juarce Martins.
They are PRM agents assigned to the Department of Protection of Natural Resources and Environment, in the district of Magude, in the province of Maputo.
According to the police, the incident occurred near the camp, in the early hours of Thursday, when the two officers were returning from a patrol activity in a protected area in that province.
"Upon hearing the shot, other colleagues ran to see what had happened and the perpetrator was immediately arrested," explained the PRM spokesperson.
According to Juarce Martins, two cases were opened against the agent, one disciplinary and the other criminal.
“The command will follow the outcome of the processes with great interest,” he concluded.
