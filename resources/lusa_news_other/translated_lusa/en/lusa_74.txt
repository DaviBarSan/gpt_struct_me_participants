A 33-year-old man was detained in preventive detention for physically and psychologically attacking his 57-year-old mother in Valongo, even after being banned from contacting and being close to her, Porto's GNR said today.
In a statement, this police force stated that the person arrested for domestic violence already has a criminal record for committing this same crime, as well as for aggravated threats, injuries and attacks on physical integrity. '
As part of this investigation, the military found that the man, to whom coercive measures of removal and prohibition of contact with his mother had already been applied due to ill-treatment, continued to physically and psychologically attack her, repeatedly, forcing her providing food and cleaning the place where he lived, he highlighted.
According to the GNR, in the most recent episode of violence, the defendant threatened and coerced his mother into giving him money to “satisfy his drug addiction”, having also destroyed property in the residence, which led to an arrest warrant.
