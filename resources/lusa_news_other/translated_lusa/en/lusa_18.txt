Luanda Medical Center building, hotel and real estate project returned to the State
The Attorney General's Office of the Republic (PGR) of Angola announced today that three more buildings and a real estate project were handed over to the National Asset Recovery Service, including the Luanda Medical Center clinic and a hotel.
At issue are the Monalisa Residence hotels, in Talatona, the Torres Eucaliptos real estate project, the Instituto Sapiens building and the Luanda Medical Center (LMC) building, located on Rua Amílcar Cabral, in the Ingombota district, all in Luanda.
The delivery was made by the legal representatives of the companies Méssene – Investimentos Limitada, Heavy Group – Investimentos Limitada, Universal Sabedoria and LMC.
These real estate projects were financed with public funds from the National Social Security Institute, and were managed by private companies, without any compensation for the State, said the PGR statement.
“Thus, with the immediate, definitive and irrevocable delivery, the assets become part of the State’s real estate assets, free of any encumbrances or charges”, the note added.
The PGR added that, “given the public utility of the Luanda Medical Center clinic, measures must be adopted to guarantee its normal functioning”.
