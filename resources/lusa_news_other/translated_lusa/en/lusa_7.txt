Father arrested for killing children to get revenge on wife in Mexico
A man was arrested in northern Mexico for allegedly beating his three children to revenge on the children's mother, prosecutors said on Sunday.
The prosecutors' office in the northern state of Sonora said the boys were 3,7 and 8 years old. The suspect called his father to tell him what he had done and the children's grandfather called the police.
The suspect fled to Sonora, but was immediately detained and sent to Hidalgo, where the deaths occurred, to be charged.
Prosecutors added that the man argued with the children's mother and killed her children "in a way that caused her great pain."
"Apparently, in revenge against his wife, he killed his children," according to a statement published by the office.
