MP accuses Braga GNR agent of embezzlement and abuse of power
The Public Ministry (MP) accused a GNR soldier from Braga of embezzlement and abuse of power for allegedly falsifying the monthly pay supplement statements, thus managing to unduly receive 5,400 euros.
According to a note published today on the website of the Porto Regional Attorney General's Office, the defendant was head of the Criminal Investigation Unit of the GNR in Braga.
“As responsible for filling out and sending for processing the monthly remuneration supplement statements, from November 2011 to October 2016, he included his name as a beneficiary of the scale supplement, although he was not entitled to receive such supplement”, states the note.
The Public Prosecutor's Office concluded that, in this way, the defendant unduly received the net amount of 5,400.17 euros.
The defendant is also accused of having ordered the military personnel of the Criminal Investigation Unit, his subordinates, to replace him in carrying out the service for which he was assigned.
