Gunman takes several hostages inside a bank in Georgia
This afternoon, an armed man took several hostages, the number still unknown, inside the premises of a bank in Georgia, authorities in this former Soviet republic reported.
The Georgian Ministry of the Interior has not yet specified how many people were taken hostage inside the bank, located in the city of Zugdidi (western region), or what the attacker's demands are.
The police, however, isolated the area where the bank branch is located and set up an operation "to neutralize the attacker", the ministry said in a statement.
Georgian state television, Mtavari TV, reported that the kidnapper is armed with a hand grenade and is demanding $500,000 (about 420,000 euros) in cash.
Mtavari TV managed to speak to one of the hostages who indicated that the attacker is holding 19 people inside the banking facilities.
The television channel also released a video showing a room with people sitting on the floor and a man dressed in a military uniform, with his face covered, and armed with a shotgun.
