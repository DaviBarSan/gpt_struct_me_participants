Islamic State claims Vienna attack
The 'jihadist' group Islamic State (IS) today claimed responsibility for the armed attack that took place on Monday in Vienna, which caused four fatalities and 22 injuries, in a statement published on its Telegram networks.
The IS statement attributes the shots fired near a synagogue and the opera house to a “soldier of the caliphate”. In a separate text, accompanied by a photo of the armed robber, the Amaq propaganda agency evokes “a firearms attack carried out yesterday [segunda-feira] by an Islamic State fighter in the city of Vienna”.
The 20-year-old perpetrator of the attack was shot dead on Monday night by police in the center of Vienna.
The young man had dual nationality, Austrian and North Macedonia, and was released on parole last December after serving part of a 22-month prison sentence for trying to travel to Syria and join the ranks of IS.
