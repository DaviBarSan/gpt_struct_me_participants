Man rescued on Tagus River is out of danger
A 68-year-old man fell into the Tagus River today, next to Cais das Colunas, in Lisbon, but is out of danger, after being rescued by another individual and transported to São José Hospital.
An official source from the Maritime Police told Lusa that the incident took place around midday and that the man was subjected to “cardiorespiratory resuscitation” at the scene. The rescue was carried out by another passerby who was passing nearby and threw himself into the water when he saw the man in difficulties.
The 68-year-old citizen was then taken by an ambulance from the National Institute of Medical Emergency (INEM) to the São José Hospital, where he is still hospitalized, but out of danger.
