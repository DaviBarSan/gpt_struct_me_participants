Man rescued after falling into a 25-meter well in Santa Maria da Feira
A man aged around 60 fell today into a well around 25 meters deep in Romariz, Santa Maria da Feira, and was rescued without serious injuries, a source from the Arrifana Fire Department told Lusa.
The fall occurred due to the fact that the lid of the well, located on a neighbor's property, broke when the man was on top, ending up falling to the depth covered by the water, the source added.
Using a wide-angle team and with the help of ropes, firefighters rescued the man at around 5:15 pm, after which he was stabilized, as he was suffering from hypothermia, and refused transport to the Santa Maria da Feira hospital. .
The GNR of Santa Maria da Feira was also at the scene and took charge of the incident.
