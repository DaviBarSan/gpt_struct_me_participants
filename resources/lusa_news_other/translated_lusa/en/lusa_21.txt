Accident in Arcos de Valdevez leaves driver in “very serious condition” - firefighters
The crash of a vehicle that occurred today in Arcos de Valdevez caused serious injuries to the driver, who was transported to Braga Hospital, informed the local fire commander.
Estrada Nacional 101 is closed to traffic due to the wreckage of the car, Filipe Guimarães told Lusa, adding that the accident involved a 'tunning' [transformed] vehicle, of which the driver, apparently, “lost control”, leaving him “polytraumatized” after the crash and hitting a pole.
Filipe Guimarães stated that a second occupant of the car, “according to eyewitnesses, threw himself from the vehicle approximately 150 meters before the collision, sustaining minor injuries”, and was transported to Viana do Castelo Hospital.
The accident occurred at 1:55 pm, in the parish of São Paio and Giela, on a road served by two lanes in each direction, and which remains “closed to traffic due to spilled vehicle oil and scattered debris”.
“It should remain cut off, at least, until 4:30 pm”, said Filipe Guimarães.
