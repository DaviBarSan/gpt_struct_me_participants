At least seven people died and seven are in critical condition following a fire in a residential building in Hong Kong, local media reported today.
The fatal victims were three men, three women and a 9-year-old child, reported the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
Three men and four women were hospitalized on Sunday night in critical condition. Two other people are in serious condition, he said.
The fire was the deadliest in Hong Kong in nearly a decade.
The apartment reportedly hosted a family gathering, but authorities are investigating whether an unlicensed restaurant operated there.
