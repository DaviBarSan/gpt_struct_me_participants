Guimarães Court sentences man to four and a half years in prison for rape
The Guimarães court convicted a man “with a dysfunctional life” for raping his friend who allowed him to stay overnight at her home, giving him an effective sentence of four and a half years in prison, the Regional Prosecutor's Office reported today.
“The court considered it proven that the defendant, on May 16, 2020, at 4:20 am, under the pretext of needing to rest, took refuge in the house of the victim, a friend of his residing in a parish of Guimarães", reports the Regional Prosecutor's Office do Porto, on its website.
He also considered it proven that, around 6:00 am, when the woman was getting ready to go to work, "he approached her, grabbed her and held her arms, forcibly removed her clothes and had sexual intercourse with her ”.
The court excludes the possibility of suspending the sentence (a possible decision of up to five years in prison) taking into account “the criminal record of the defendant, and the personality alienated from the legal obligation that emerges from them, as well as the unstructured life he presented” .
