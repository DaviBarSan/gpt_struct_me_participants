Footballer Quincy Promes arrested on suspicion of stabbing family member
Dutch international Quincy Promes, an Ajax footballer, was arrested for allegedly stabbing a family member in July, Dutch media reported today, citing police sources.
According to the daily De Telegraaf, after a strong argument during a family celebration, Promes stabbed the victim in the neck, leaving him seriously injured. Some of those present at the party stood between the two, which would have prevented a more serious outcome.
The incident reportedly took place in a warehouse, owned by Promes, located in Abcoude, a small town in the province of Utrecht.
The complaint was filed in November and gave rise to “an investigation that led to an arrest this morning”, said a police source, cited by that newspaper.
In the Netherlands, the maximum sentence for an offense of serious injury resulting from physical assault is four years.
The 28-year-old forward represented the Dutch national team in 40 games, in which he scored seven goals. Professional since 2012, at Twente, he also played for Spartak Moscow and Seville, before signing for Ajax in 2019/20.
