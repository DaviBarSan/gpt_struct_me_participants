GNR injures a man using a firearm with rubber bullets in Cabeceiras de Basto
The GNR slightly injured a man in Cabeceiras de Basto who was firing into the air with live ammunition and who refused to stop with “rubber bullets” (rubber bullets), a police source said today.
The case occurred in the parish of Refojos de Basto, municipality of Cabeceiras de Basto, district of Braga, shortly before 00:00.
The 52-year-old man was hit in the legs by rubber bullets.
A source from the GNR Territorial Command in Braga told the Lusa agency that the operatives only hit the man after he disobeyed the order to stop shooting.
“It didn’t even stop when the military fired intimidating shots into the air,” added the source, who stated that he did not know the causes of the detainee’s behavior.
After being treated for minor injuries in a hospital unit, he was detained at the GNR post in Cabeceiras and will appear before the investigating judge today to establish the coercive measures deemed appropriate.
As the case involved firearms, the Judiciary Police will be informed of details, said the source.
