Angolan police authorities prevent attempted trafficking of Congolese minors
The Criminal Investigation Service (SIC) foiled the attempted trafficking of three children from the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDCongo), in the city of Dundo, Angolan province of Lunda Norte, Angolan authorities reported today.
According to the SIC spokesperson in Lunda Norte, Veríssimo Pandamari, the children, aged 9 and 12, were being taken by two alleged traffickers, who intended to travel with the minors to Luanda, capital of Angola, for their alleged commercialization.
Veríssimo Pandamari, quoted by the Angolan news agency, Angop, said that the men were detained during an operation called "Kudissanga", which included the collaboration of members of the public.
The attempted trafficking of these minors is the third recorded this year, after the first at the beginning of the year and the second in July.
