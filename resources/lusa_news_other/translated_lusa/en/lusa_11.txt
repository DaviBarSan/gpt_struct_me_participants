Woman run over during seafood protest in Murtosa
A 44-year-old woman was seriously run over today in Murtosa, district of Aveiro, during a protest with around dozens of shellfish gatherers, reported the Fire Department and the GNR.
The incident occurred at around 12:50, next to the Torreira pier.
Speaking to Lusa, a GNR source said that the driver of the vehicle was a man transporting bivalves and that he was trying to leave the place.
“The fishermen tried to prevent him from leaving there. The situation got a little heated and you forced the car to leave, having run over a lady”, said the same source.
According to firefighters, the woman suffered minor injuries and was transported to Aveiro Hospital.
The GNR also stated that the driver fled, but has since been identified.
Torreira shellfish gatherers have been protesting for more than a week, due to the fact that they cannot work, as excessive percentages of fecal coliforms have been detected in the waters of the Aveiro Ria.
