PJ arrests man from Penafiel who stabbed his wife to death for “futile reasons”
The Judiciary Police (PJ) arrested the Penafiel man accused of stabbing his wife to death in the early hours of Monday, the Northern Directorate of that corporation announced today, which attributed the murder to “futile reasons”.
“According to the elements collected during the investigation, the defendant allegedly attacked the victim with a bladed weapon during an argument for futile reasons,” the PJ’s Northern Directorate said in a statement.
The GNR, the first police force to arrive at the scene of the crime, said on Monday that the motivation of the alleged killer, aged 72, against whom there had been no complaints of domestic violence, was unclear.
The case occurred at around 5:30 am, in the parish of Duas Igrejas, municipality of Penafiel, in the district of Porto.
Emergency services found the 74-year-old victim in cardiorespiratory arrest, and maneuvers to reverse the situation were unsuccessful, so death was confirmed at the scene.
The detainee, a construction worker with no criminal record, will be brought before the judicial authority for the first judicial interrogation and application of coercive measures deemed appropriate.
